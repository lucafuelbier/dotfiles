# Dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles, settings and configurations that
I use for my daily work.

The files are grouped into folders, corresponding to the application,
that the dotfile belongs to.

## Example ##

The Visual Studio Code user settings file is located at
`vscode/settings.json`.
